    <h2>– Course Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      As someone with a strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML and CSS, I am excited to expand my skill set by learning advanced scripting languages such as JavaScript and React JS. Having completed a few minor projects using HTML and CSS, I understand the importance of building dynamic and responsive web applications. My current enrollment in a React course on Udemy reflects my commitment to continuous learning, and I’m eager to apply this knowledge in practical, real-world projects. 
      I believe this course will deepen my understanding of modern web development and strengthen my ability to write clean, efficient, and interactive code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I aspire to become a full-stack developer, and I see this subject as a vital step toward that goal. React JS, being one of the most sought-after technologies in today’s job market, offers the power to build scalable and performance-driven applications. Through this course, I expect to gain hands-on experience, industry-relevant insights, and mentorship that will help me bridge the gap between theory and application. I look forward to building a portfolio of meaningful work and 
      sharpening both my problem-solving and collaborative skills.
